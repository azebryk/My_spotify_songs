# Analysis and Clustring of My Favorite Spotify Songs: Project Overview


I am huge music fan and, in my opinion, there is no obvious pattern what types of songs I like. Therefore, I decided to look  a little bit deeper into it, perform analysis and try to distinguish some groups.

The aim of this project is to analyze and cluster my favorite Spotify songs. This project consist following steps:
* Data gathering 
* Data preparation and exploratory analysis of my streaming history.
* Spotify API: Adjsuting class from https://github.com/codingforentrepreneurs/. Adding extra methods for my case. 
* K-Means clustering. Finding accurate numer of clusters using elbow method.
* Cluster visualisation using TSNE.


## Technologies Used:

*	Python version 3.8.3
*	Pandas
*	Numpy
*	Matplotlib
*	Seaborn 
* Spotify API
*	JSON
*	Requests
*	urlib.parse
* base64
* K-means clustering
* TSNE


## Data Sources and Preparation:
1.  My streaming history.
- I reequested songs, which I listned to during last 365 days  from Spotify website. Then I kept only songs, which was played more than 5 times.
2. Spotify API
- I used it to get details about each song, audio features like danceability, loudness or tempo.
Explenation of all aufio features can be found at Spotify's developers page https://developer.spotify.com/discover/.
For this I used code from https://github.com/codingforentrepreneurs/
I modified this code and added methods to the class aproperate to my case.



## EDA
I looked at the general info and distributions of the data. Here are some highlights:
### Distribution of audio features

</p>
Summary:
- I'd rather like energetic electronic/rock/pop music, so the acousticness and speechiness of my songs is close to 0 and energy and danceability close to 1.

- The mode in the tempo distribution is close to 126 BPM - most of EDM songs have such a tempo

- Instrumentalness looks strange. For better understanding I plotted cumulative histogram.
### Distribution of Instrumentalness
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/azebryk/My_spotify_songs/blob/master/images/instrumentalness.png" width=700>
</p>
- As we can see, only 10 % of my songs have instrumentalness above 0.15, but 75% has it below 0.002883, so on the histogram we have high peak close to 0.

### Correlations
<p align="center">

</p>

- We can see positive correlation between loudness and energey, which makes sense and between danceability and valence (musical positiveness), so it's also correct so you always want to dance to positive sounds :)
- Acousticness is negativly correlated with most of the other features, escpecially with energy.



## Clustering
As it was shown in distribution above features have different ranges. To perform correct clustering using K-Means algorithm all features have been standarized using StandardScaler.
### K-Means Clustering - Number of clusters
There are several methods to determine the best number of clusters. In this project I used 2 of those.
1. Elbow method - this method is based on plot of Distortion Score for different number of clusters. We should select point in which we have "elbow". This visualisation was made using yellowbrick library.

Selecting number of clusters using elbow method:

</p>
Number of cluster based on elbow method: **6**.

2. The silhouette method -  computes silhouette coefficients of each point that measure how much a point is similar to its own cluster compared to other clusters. by providing a succinct graphical representation of how well each object has been classified.

## Cluster visualisation using TSNE.

## Model Evaluation
In unsupervised clustering we do not have target features and labels to easily score our model. Because so, we will perform EDA for both 3 and 6 clusters to determine which model is more accurate and what are the profiles of our clusters.

1. Distribution of the clusters.
<p align="center">

</p>
We can see imbalance in different clusters.

2. Detailed investigation of the clusters.
- Energy

- Tempo

- Acousticness

## Clusters explenation
Based on model evaluation and investigation I will focus on 2 clusters that stand out: cluster nr 5 and 4.

### Cluster nr 5 - EDM songs
I will start with cluster nr 5, since it was clearly separated from all other songs on the t-SNE visualisation. Based on model evaluation it has:
- the highest energy
- the lowest acousticness
- the narrowest IQR in tempo box plot
Most of the songs in that cluster has tempo close to 126 BPM, which is typical tempo for EDM songs. Looking at the artist and titles of the songs this is definietly true. Top artists in that cluster are Oliver Heldens, Tiesto and Dillon Francis.

### Cluster nr 4
This cluster is the oposite of cluster nr 5. Based on model evaluation it has:
- the lowest energy and loudness
- the highest acousticness
It looks like this cluster is formed by slower songs that I have streamed. The songs that have landed here are from Muse, my fav rock band that apart of energetic rock songs has also beautiful ballads, but also from rapers Jay-Z and Post Malone.
