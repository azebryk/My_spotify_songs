# Analysis and Clustring of My Favorite Spotify Songs: Project Overview


I am huge music fan and, in my opinion, there is no obvious pattern what types of songs I like. Therefore, I decided to look  a little bit deeper into it, perform analysis and try to distinguish some groups.

The aim of this project is to analyze and cluster my favorite Spotify songs. This project consist following steps:
* Data gathering 
* Data preparation and exploratory analysis of my streaming history.
* Spotify API: Adjsuting class from https://github.com/codingforentrepreneurs/. Adding extra methods for my case. 
* K-Means clustering. Finding accurate numer of clusters using elbow method.
* Cluster visualisation using TSNE.


## Technologies Used:

*	Python version 3.8.3
*	Pandas
*	Numpy
*	Matplotlib
*	Seaborn 
* Spotify API
*	JSON
*	Requests
*	urlib.parse
* base64
* K-means clustering
* TSNE


## Data Sources and Preparation:
1.  My streaming history.
- I reequested songs, which I listned to during last 365 days  from Spotify website. Then I kept only songs, which was played more than 5 times.
2. Spotify API
- I used it to get details about each song, audio features like danceability, loudness or tempo.
Explenation of all aufio features can be found at Spotify's developers page https://developer.spotify.com/discover/.
For this I used code from https://github.com/codingforentrepreneurs/
I modified this code and added methods to the class aproperate to my case.



## EDA
I looked at the general info and distributions of the data. Here are some highlights:
### Distribution of audio features

</p>
Summary:
- I'd rather like energetic electronic/rock/pop music, so the acousticness and speechiness of my songs is close to 0 and energy and danceability close to 1.

- The mode in the tempo distribution is close to 126 BPM - most of EDM songs have such a tempo

- Instrumentalness looks strange. For better understanding I plotted cumulative histogram.
### Distribution of Instrumentalness

</p>
- As we can see, only 10 % of my songs have instrumentalness above 0.15, but 75% has it below 0.002883, so on the histogram we have high peak close to 0.

### Correlations

</p>

- We can see positive correlation between loudness and energey, which makes sense and between danceability and valence (musical positiveness), so it's also correct so you always want to dance to positive sounds :)
- Acousticness is negativly correlated with most of the other features, escpecially with energy.



## Clustering
As it was shown in distribution above features have different ranges. To perform correct clustering using K-Means algorithm all features have been standarized using StandardScaler.
### K-Means Clustering - Number of clusters
There are several methods to determine the best number of clusters. In this project I used 2 of those.
1. Elbow method - this method is based on plot of Distortion Score for different number of clusters. We should select point in which we have "elbow". This visualisation was made using yellowbrick library.

Selecting number of clusters using elbow method:

</p>
Number of cluster based on elbow method: 7.
2. The silhouette method -  computes silhouette coefficients of each point that measure how much a point is similar to its own cluster compared to other clusters. by providing a succinct graphical representation of how well each object has been classified.

## Next steps:

Deeper analysis of 3 different clusters.
